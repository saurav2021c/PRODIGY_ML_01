# Linear-Regression-Model-for-House-Price-Prediction
## Prodigy Infotech ML Internship Task 1

### Description:
In this project I have created Machine Learning Linear Regression Model. Analyzed a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. Done Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions. 

House price prediction is the process of using data to estimate the value of a
house. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to determine the value
of a home for sale, to assess the risk of a mortgage, or to make investment
decisions.
There are a variety of different methods that can be used to predict house prices. Some of
the most common methods include:
- Linear regression: This is a simple method that uses a straight line to predict the value of
a house.
- Random forest: This is a more complex method that uses a group of decision trees to make
predictions.
- Gradient boosting: This is a technique that combines multiple models to make predictions.

The accuracy of house price prediction models can vary depending on the quality
of the data and the method that is used. However, these models can be a valuable
tool for making informed decisions about the housing market.

Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

- 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of householder of the city house is located in.
- 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg. Age of Houses in same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg. Number of Rooms for Houses in same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg. Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city.
- 'Area Population': Population of city.
- 'Price': Price that the house sold at.
- 'Address': Address of the houses.
